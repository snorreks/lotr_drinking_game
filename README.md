# Drinking Game designed around LotR

Based upon [this article](https://psycatgames.com/magazine/party-games/the-lord-of-the-rings/) by [PsyCat Games](https://psycatgames.com/), the team created the idea of having an application which would allow every player to pick a character, and manage their rules along with the rules available for everyone. Developed in Flutter so it can be available for everyone ðŸ˜¼

## DISCLAIMER

We do not condone the use of Ã¦lkis, this is just made for fun. Stay aware of how much you drink and take care of eachother if you decide to brave upon this drinking game, since it's pretty damn potent. The characters used are only referred to, and we are not using the likeness of the characters from the series in a copyright infringing matter.
