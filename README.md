# Drinking Game designed around LotR
Based upon [this article](https://psycatgames.com/magazine/party-games/the-lord-of-the-rings/) by [PsyCat Games](https://psycatgames.com/), the team created the idea of having an application which would allow every player to pick a character, and manage their rules along with the rules available for everyone. Developed in Flutter so it can be available for everyone ;) 


## Use it now!
You can already access the application. Create a session and invite your friends to join.

## Features
  * Unique character for each player
  * Navigation of rules
  * Compare how much you have had to drink with the rest of the group
  * idk more soon

### Coming features
* Blood-alcohol percentage calculator (based on standard ABV of 4.7%)
* Rules modifications
* Admin rights
* Regular "status" check-ups & other Safety features
* Create your own drinking game!
* Call-out players for ignoring rules!

## Build and host it yourself (?)
Fork this and make it work homie, we used firebase and it sure as hell is working well.

# DISCLAIMER
We do not condone the use of Ã¦lkis, this is just made for fun. Stay aware of how much you drink and take care of eachother if you decide to brave upon this drinking game, since it's pretty damn potent. The characters used are only referred to, and we are not using the likeness of the characters from the series in a copyright infringing matter.
