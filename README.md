# Drinking Game designed around LotR
Based upon [this article](https://psycatgames.com/magazine/party-games/the-lord-of-the-rings/) by [PsyCat Games](https://psycatgames.com/), the team created the idea of having an application which would allow every player to pick a character, and manage their rules along with the rules available for everyone. Developed in Flutter so it can be available for everyone ;) 


## Use it now!
You can already access the application [here](https://lotr-drinking-game.web.app/). Create a session and invite your friends to join.

## Features
  * Unique character for each player
  * Navigation of rules
  * Compare how much you have had to drink with the rest of the group
  * idk more soon

## Build and host it yourself (?)
Fork this and make it work homie, we used firebase and it sure as hell is working well.
